# inheritance and code reuse
## code: bst: a storage class, a node class

# abstract classes
## code e.g. SortedStorage might define commonly used components

# so what are abstract classes
## code simple abstract: toyota,camry

# when to use abstract classes
## code another abstract example: car, toyota, camry

# when not to use abstract classes
## code: Honkable, Pilotable, plane, boeing, b737

# interfaces
## drawing: show whole tree with interfaces

# when to use interfaces
## code: plane, airbus, a321

# when not to use interfaces
## code: car, honda, accord
